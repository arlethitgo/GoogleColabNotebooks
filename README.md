**1. How to Tabulate PSE EOD Data.ipynb** - Philippine Stock Exchange End of Day Data Automated Extraction from PDF Files using tabula-py.
            ***This script is used to automate extraction of PSE Data from the PSE EOD pdf files into a csv file ***

tabula-py is a tool for convert PDF tables to pandas DataFrame. tabula-py is a wrapper of [tabula-java](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula-java), which requires java on your machine. tabula-py also enables you to convert tables in a PDF into CSV/TSV files.

tabula-py's PDF extraction accuracy is same as tabula-java or [tabula app](https://tabula.technology/); GUI tool of tabula, so if you want to know the performance of tabula-py, I highly recommend you to try tabula app.

tabula-py is good for:
      - automation with Python script
      - advanced analytics after converting pandas DataFrame
      - casual analytics with Jupyter notebook or Google Colaboratory
